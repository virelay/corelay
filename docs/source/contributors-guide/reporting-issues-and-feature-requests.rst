If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, we encourage you to submit an issue on our `GitHub page <https://github.com/virelay/corelay/issues>`_. Before creating a new issue, please review existing issues to avoid duplicate efforts and ensure that your report adds value. If you find an open issue related to the same problem, feel free to contribute additional information or context to help us resolve it more efficiently.

When submitting a new issue, provide as much relevant information as possible to facilitate prompt identification and resolution of the problem. This includes:

* The CoRelAy version you are using
* Any pertinent configuration settings or dependencies

Also, please provide a clear, step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the issue. This will enable us to diagnose and fix the problem more quickly. If possible, including a minimal example that reproduces the issue (i.e., input data, code example, and analysis results) is highly appreciated.

You may also file an issue if you have a feature request or enhancement suggestion. Please provide a clear description of the desired feature, its potential benefits, and any relevant use cases. This will help us understand the value of the proposed change and prioritize it accordingly.
