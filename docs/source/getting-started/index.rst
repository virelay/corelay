Welcome to CoRelAy! In this section, we'll guide you through the process of getting started with CoRelAy, covering installation, key concepts, and usage examples. Read our :doc:`installation guide <installation>` for instructions on how to install CoRelAy on your system. Check out our :doc:`basic usage guide <basic-usage>` for an overview of key concepts and how to use CoRelAy to analyze data. If you want an in-depth example of using CoRelAy, read our :doc:`example project guide <example-project>`, which guides you through the creation of a more complex CoRelAy project, that implements a spectral relevance analysis (SpRAy) :cite:p:`lapuschkin2019spray` pipeline and outputs a database that is ready to be visualized using `ViRelAy <https://github.com/virelay/virelay>`_.
