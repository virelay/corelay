Welcome to the documentation of CoRelAy, a library designed for composing efficient, single-machine data analysis pipelines. CoRelAy enables the rapid implementation of pipelines that can be used to analyze and process data. CoRelAy is primarily meant for the use in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), often with the goal of producing output suitable for visualization in tools like `ViRelAy <https://github.com/virelay/virelay>`_.

At the core of CoRelAy are **pipelines**, which consist of a series of **tasks**. Each task is a modular unit that can be populated with operations to perform specific data processing tasks. These operations, known as **processors**, can be customized by assigning new processor instances to the tasks.

Tasks in CoRelAy are highly flexible and can be tailored to meet the needs of your analysis pipeline. By leveraging a wide range of built-in configurable processors with their respective **parameters**, you can easily adapt and optimize your data processing workflow.

.. note::

    If you come from a previous version of CoRelAy before the 1.0.0 release, please refer to the :doc:`migration guide <migration-guide/migrating-from-v0.2-to-v1.0>` for information on how to transition to the latest version. Some breaking changes have been introduced, and the migration guide will help you adapt your existing code to the new version.

Contents
========
