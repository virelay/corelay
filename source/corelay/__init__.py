"""CoRelAy is a package to compose small-scale (single-machine) analysis pipelines. Pipelines are designed with a number of steps (``Task``) with
default operations (``Processor``). Any step of the pipeline may then be individually changed by assigning a new operator (``Processor``). Processors
have parameters (``Param``) which define their operation.
