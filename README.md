**CoRelAy** is a library designed for composing efficient, single-machine data analysis pipelines. It enables the rapid implementation of pipelines that can be used to analyze and process data. CoRelAy is primarily meant for the use in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), often with the goal of producing output suitable for visualization in tools like [**ViRelAy**](https://github.com/virelay/virelay).

At the core of CoRelAy are **pipelines** (`Pipeline`), which consist of a series of **tasks** (`Task`). Each task is a modular unit that can be populated with **operations** (`Processor`) to perform specific data processing tasks. These operations, known as processors, can be customized by assigning new instances or modifying their default configurations.

Tasks in CoRelAy are highly flexible and can be tailored to meet the needs of your analysis pipeline. By leveraging a wide range of configurable **processors** with their respective **parameters** (`Param`), you can easily adapt and optimize your data processing workflow.

For more information about CoRelAy, getting started guides, in-depth tutorials, and API documentation, please refer to the [documentation](https://corelay.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Features

- **Pipeline Composition**: CoRelAy allows you to compose pipelines of processors, which can be executed in parallel or sequentially.
- **Task-based Design**: Each step in the pipeline is represented as a task, which can be easily modified or replaced.
- **Processor Library**: CoRelAy comes with a library of built-in processors for common tasks, such as clustering, embedding, and dimensionality reduction.
- **Memoization**: CoRelAy supports memoization of intermediate results, allowing you to reuse previously computed results and speed up your analysis.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started, you first have to install CoRelAy on your system. The recommended and easiest way to install CoRelAy is to use `pip`, the Python package manager. You can install CoRelAy using the following command:

```shell
$ pip install corelay
```

> [!NOTE]
> CoRelAy depends on the [`metrohash-python`](https://pypi.org/project/metrohash-python/) library, which requires a C++ compiler to be installed. This may mean that you will have to install extra packages (GCC or Clang) for the installation to succeed. For example, on Fedora, you may have to install the `gcc-c++` package in order to make the `c++` command available, which can be done using the following command:
>
> ```shell
> $ sudo dnf install gcc-c++
> ```

To install CoRelAy with optional HDBSCAN and UMAP support, use

```shell
$ pip install corelay[umap,hdbscan]
```

### Usage

Examples to highlight some features of CoRelAy can be found in [`docs/examples`](https://github.com/virelay/corelay/tree/main/docs/examples).

We mainly use HDF5 files to store results. If you wish to visualize your analysis results using **ViRelAy**, please have a look at the [**ViRelAy documentation**](https://virelay.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors-guide/database-specification.html) to find out more about its database specification. An example to create HDF5 files which can be used with **ViRelAy** is shown in [`docs/examples/hdf5_structure.py`](https://github.com/virelay/corelay/tree/main/docs/examples/hdf5_structure.py).

To do a full SpRAy analysis which can be visualized with **ViRelAy**, an advanced script can be found in [`docs/examples/virelay_analysis.py`](https://github.com/virelay/corelay/tree/main/docs/examples/virelay_analysis.py).
